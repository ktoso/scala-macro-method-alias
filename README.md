scala-macro-delegate
====================
scala-macro-delegate makes it possible to delegate to other methods without actually writing the delegation code.

The idea came up during a Scala User Group meetup after JFokus where we were discussing how Akka has
to maintain 2 APIs at the same time - an example would be `tell` and `!` (where `tell` is referred to as "Java API").
âˆšictor jokingly said that a `@delegate` annotation would be fun, I came back to this idea while me and my friend were
waiting for our plane back home to Poland. Turns out it's doable and doesn't even look all too bad - see for yourself.
